# Discover Our Work

## What is this project?

We want to make it easy for people to find and filter 18F projects in different ways. The filters are based on information in each repo's [about.yml](https://github.com/18F/about_yml) file. 

## Getting started

This project is built with `node v5.0.x` and `npm v3.3.x`. We use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage different versions of `node` but you're welcome to use whatever tool works for you. You can check the version of either `node` or `npm` with the `-v` flag.

### Steps to install and run project

0. `$ git clone git@github.com:18F/discover-our-work.git && cd discover-our-work`
0. `$ bundle install`
0. `$ npm install`
0. `$ npm start` - The project should then be live at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/]()
